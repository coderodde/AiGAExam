# Running instructions

First, you need to clone this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/coderodde/AiGAExam.git
```

Next, in Linux:
```
cd AiGAExam/target/classes
```
... or in Windows:
```
cd AiGAExam\target\classes
```

Finally, in order to run the task `X`, type:
```
java taskX.TaskX
```
where `X = 0, 1, ..., 7`.
